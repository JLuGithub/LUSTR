LUSTR is designed to genotype germline or somatic alleles by their repeat sizes at each user pointed short tandem repeat (STR) locus. LUSTR requires pre-installation of samtools to process .sam/.bam files. LUSTR is written in perl script and can be run directly without installation.

Requirements: samtools, mapping tool (e.g. bwa mem).

Installation: To run LUSTR, simply copy all LUSTR_*.pl to any folder.

For quick start, follow the guidance in QuickGuide.txt.
